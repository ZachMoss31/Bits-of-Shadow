# Bits-Of-Shadow
Unity project updated to quickly develop, test, and implement Unity game via Unity Software Engineering development pipeline. Target is to update an old college project with multiple builds, shading, and CI/CD along with sprinting.

## Desired Functionality
* As a player, I want to launch a game from Web, Windows, and eventual console support (possibly mobile)
* As a player, I want to launch my game from a single .exe
* As a player, I want an engaging gaming experience with modern graphics quality
* As a player, I want to see past runs of my level and compare (or compete) with friends

* As a developer, I need CI/CD functionality for multiple builds and versions
* As a developer, I want to learn HLSL for my projects art direction

## Projected Tasking
* Basics of Unity shading via HLSL for glowing, lighting, and electric effect
* Updated control inputs and camera movement for a more engaging and customizable experience (eventual key mapping)
* Jenkins or Git CI/CD pipeline 
* Atlassian Jira sprinting for overall project health
* Juggling of multiple projects for more realistic development tasking experience

## Links
* Site where description can be fully parsed
* WebGL link of project build
* Jira and documentation page for classes and sprinting
